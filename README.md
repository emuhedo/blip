Blip is an attempt to make the world a better place with easier HTTP(S) transactions.

### Common Questions
 - **Why doesn't the API have methods for each HTTP verb, e.g. GET, POST, PUT?**
   - No doubt those convenience methods are handy. But, they aren't without a cost -- increasing the API surface. Blip has chosen to have as small an API surface as possible, so we've decided to forego those convenience methods.
